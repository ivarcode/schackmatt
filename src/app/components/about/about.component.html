        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <h6>
            The goal of Chess Trainer Hub is to help players of all levels
            improve their chess skills through pattern recognition, repetition
            and challenging puzzles via an interactive chess board.
        </h6>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <h6>
            Chess Trainer Hub is built around lessons and practice scenarios.
            Players will be able to learn the concepts and material and then
            proceed to play those scenarios out in the interface.
        </h6>
        <h6>
            This will help to learn and understand the main idea, but be able to
            see the position played out in multiple scenarios.
        </h6>
        <h6>
            Understanding the theory is one thing, but being able to identify
            and execute the winning plan is how you improve.
