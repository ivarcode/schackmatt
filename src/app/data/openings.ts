                "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 Bxb4 5. c3 Be7 { The Be7 variation (named after Adolf Anderssen) is perhaps the most equalizing variation for black of the Evan’s Gambit. Black chooses to take a more passive defense and overprotect the g5 square with both the dark squared bishop and queen. The drawback to this opening for black is how passive it feels. Black has captured a pawn, but has moved the bishop 3 times, with the last movement to a defensive square. Nevertheless, it is worth knowing how to play against as white and what ideas change in comparison to the other move 6 variations. } 6. d4 { This move opens the lines for the dark squared bishop, which can now hit the defender of f7. Note that the same ideas of the Evan’s Gambit are in effect: you want to continue pressure on f7 and stop black from castling. White is planning to play Qb3 to attack f7 twice. The black kingside knight has not developed yet, so it is likely to go to h6 to overdefend f7. D4 helps prevent this and attacks the center. } (6. Qb3 { Louis De la Bourdonnais vs Boncourt 1836 The next variation focuses on White following up Be7 with an immediate attack on f7. Note that d4 was necessary to prevent Nh6, which overprotects the f7 pawn. Na5 is not immediately accurate because white captures f7 with check. This leads to an equal material game where black’s king position is weakened. Nh6 allows black to castle earlier, but the eventual d4 means the g file may open up against black’s king if he does castle. } { [%cal Gc1h6,Gg8h6] } 6... Nh6 7. d4 Na5 8. Qb5 Nxc4 9. Bxh6 (9.

Ne3 { This is an equal line and black’s best chance to equalize. Sure it’s not winning for white, but this is part of why the Evan’s Gambit is not irrefutable. Looking at the position, you can choose either side to play as and be alright. Let’s break down why: For white castling can be achieved immediately The c3 pawn makes the dark squared bishop awkward. Achieving c4 and d4 will give the knight a great square on c3 White has 3 pawn islands For black Casling can be achieved in 2 moves The bishop pair is maintained The queen is centralized, but can be an easy target once white castles })  (7. Be2 { Gary Kasparov vs Vichywanathan Anand 1995 Note: the normal move is Be3. Since black intends to castle kingside, the eventual movement of the e4 pawn will give some pressure on h7. Garry Kasparov tried out 7.Be2!?, against which Black should probably reinforce the e5-pawn with 7…d6 rather than heading into what happened. You should also note that black is still not quite developed. It’s hard to develop the kingside knight right now because nh6 can open the kingside and g file, while nf6 leads to a gain of tempo with dxe5. } 7... exd4 8.
