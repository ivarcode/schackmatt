1... Ke8 { A backrank checkmate occurs when the king is on the 1st or 8th row of a chess board and checkmate is delivered. It must be given by a rook or queen as they are the only pieces that attack horizontally.
This typical formation of 3 pawns is a common sight for either king. It is most common after castling because it provides safety. However, if you aren’t able to give your king an escape square, you can fall victim to backrank mates. } 2. Qb8# *

1... Kc6 { To checkmate with two queens, the easiest method to learn is the Staircase Method. This is not the only way, and not the quickest, but is an easy way to master. This will help you learn the idea of how to checkmate.
Let’s start with two queens as they are the easiest to use and protect each other along the way
The staircase method involves slowly pushing the king to the edge of the board, alternating which queen and queen.
Let’s start with Qd2 and checkmate the king by alternating the queens along the second rank. } 2. Qfd2 Kb5 { The king has moved further to the back rank. Let's take away the third rank by alternating queens with Qc3. } 3. Qec3 Kb6 { The king stayed on the second rank so we should continue alternating our queens towards the a file. } 4. Qdb2+ Ka7 { To maintain the pattern to recognize, let's complete the checkmate with Qa3. Qa5 is also an option. } 5. Qca3# *

1... Kd6 { This checkmate is similar to two queens, except you will need your queen to be further away from the black king. This means you can complete the staircase mate without any thought as your queen will always protect the rook.
With the pieces flipped around, you won't be able to check with the queen as easily as the king can capture the queen if it is unprotected. } 2. Rd4+ Ke5 { We are now 4 files away from the north and east edges of the board.
Choose to move towards whichever edge of the board you'd like. } 3. Qe3+ (3. Qc5+ Kf6 { We can now alternate our rook and queen along the c and d files until the king is at the edge of the board } 4.

1... Kc6 { Just like the 2 queen checkmate or the queen and rook, you want to alternate files, taking squares away.
With two rooks, you will need to “waste a move” or “mark time." This means spending a move with a rook and forcing the black king to move.
Since rooks can control an entire file or rank from multiple squares, this is the ideal way to waste a move.
Because the king can capture one of the rooks if unprotected, it’s important to remember this.
If you accidentally allow the king to capture 1 rook, you will need to give checkmate with a rook and king alone, covered below.
Let's move our b5 rook as far away from the king as possible, but still on the 4th rank. } 2. Rh5 Kb6 { With the king so close to our rook on the 4th, we cannot continue pushing the king to the edge of the board. To mark time, we should move our a4 rook as far away from the king as possible on the 4th rank, but diagonally next to the h5 rook.
This allows the rooks to alternate pushing the king to the edge of the board, without getting in each other's way. } 3. Rg4 { We can now push the king to the top edge of the board. } 3... Kc6 { Now begin alternating your rooks in the same fashion as the staircase method with the queens. } 4. Rg6+ Kd7 5. Rh7+ Ke8 6. Rg8# *

1... Kd6 { The easiest way to learn how to checkmate with a queen and king is the Box method. This can be used for a rook endgame as well in a similar fashion.
The box method involves closing your opponent into a smaller and smaller imaginary box on the board.
Let's begin with Qb5 to limit the king from moving away from our king. } 2. Qb5 Ke7 { Notice how the queen starts the king off in a box from a4-a8-h8-h4.
Moving the queen to b5 makes the box smaller (b5-b8-h8-h5).
The king should move to e6 to avoid making the box smaller. Any other move will give a quicker mate as the queen will reduce the size of the box without moving the king.
With the king on e7 now, we can make the box smaller by moving to the third rank. } (2... Kc7 { Whenever the king moves backwards, continue to take away its chance to come forward. } 3. Qa6 Kd7 { We have two options now. Both allow us to move the king to the back rank in the subsequent move.
Let's play Ke5. } 4. Ke5 (4. Kd5 Ke7 { We can force the king backwards with Qe6, however, there is a quicker way to deliver checkmate.
Let's keep the king from moving any further away from the king and force him back.

Let's play Qb7 to keep the king on the back rank. } (5... Kc8 { We can now keep the king on the backrank with a king move. } 6. Kd6 Kd8 7. Qd7# (7. Qb8#)) 6. Qb7 Ke8 { Take the opposition. } 7.

Kf6 Kg8 (6... Ke8 7. Qe7#) 7. Qg7#) 3. Qc6 Kf7 { Now we need to bring our king closer. In this scenario, it's best done by taking the direct opposition.
Opposition involves both kings being 1 square apart, essentially staring at each other daring them to step forward, but they can’t! } 4. Kf5 Ke7 { The king can now be forced to the edge of the board with either Qc7 or Qe6.
Let's move to Qc7 to continue the box idea. } 5. Qc7+ Kf8 { We again want to take the direct opposition for the quickest checkmate. } 6. Kf6 Kg8 (6... Ke8 7. Qe7#) 7. Qg7# *

1... Ke6 { Checkmating with a rook alone is not as easy as checkmating with a queen alone, but it employs the same Box methodology.
The best way is to slowly push your opponent back to the edge of the board again, but this time you’ll want to maintain opposition before pushing the opponent’s king.
Since the kings are in opposition, we want to take the third rank away from the king and push him backwards. } 2. Rc6+ Ke7 { The rook pushed the king back with check, and the white king controls the squares it can move forward. You will want to continue to achieve this formation until the king is on the edge of the board.
Now we want to grab the opposition. } 3. Ke5 Kd7 { When the king moves close to the rook, for the box method to be followed, it must move to the other side of the king, as far away as possible.
However, in this scenario, we are able to force the black king into opposition by keeping the rook on the c file. We can move to c1, c2, c3, c4, or c5 safely without being captured.
Let's move the rook to c2. } 4. Rc2 Ke7 { Continue forcing the king to the edge until checkmate is delivered. } 5. Rc7+ Kd8 { Let's take the opposition again to force the king to run to the corner. } 6. Kd6 Ke8 { If the defending king tries to get sneaky by going back and forth (this can sometimes trip up beginner players) then you’lll want to remember to skip a move where possible, as above.
Skipping a move, or marking time, is a chess term that is used when you want to force your opponent into a bad position (zugswang).
This will reduce the number of moves you need to achieve checkmate.
Since you can’t actually skip your turn, you can make a move on the board that seemingly wastes a move, but is really designed to put your opponent into a position they don’t want to be in and make a move they don’t want to make.
White must “mark time” by moving the rook without allowing the king to attack it. Keeping the threat of checkmate if the black king moves into opposition at any time.
Let's move the rook to a7, as far away as possible, just in case. } 7. Ra7 Kf8 { Follow the king } 8. Ke6 Kg8 { Follow the king } 9. Kf6 Kh8 { Follow the king } 10. Kg6 Kg8 { The king was forced to come back into opposition and now we can deliver checkmate.
Be sure to remember that your rook won’t be able to protect itself as easily as a queen. Always make sure your rook is protected or has a nice amount of checking distance from the king. } 11. Ra8# *

You can often force this scenario when the c or f pawn has moved and the diagonal striking the king is open. } 2. Qd5+ Kh8 { Had the king moved to f8 right away, checkmate on f7.
We can now check the king and force him to move into xray vision of the queen. } 3. Nf7+ Kg8 { We now want to double check the king by moving the knight and creating a discovered check. Whenever double check occurs, the king must move. We already know the king cannot move to f8. } 4.

1... Rg7 { An Opera checkmate occurs with a bishop (or queen) and a rook. Like Anastasia’s Mate, the opponent’s pawn usually helps remove a square the king can move to.
This checkmate is most common when the bishop is able to occupy the squares a defensive fianchetto would. This means you want to watch out for this type of mate when you fianchetto your bishop and trade it away for a knight.

The pattern involves the pawn protecting the knight and the rook checks the king. When the king moves closer to the knight, you can checkmate the king with the rook where it is protected by the knight.
Begin by checking the king. } 2. Rh8+ Kb7 { The only escape square for the king is b6. We can check and remove this flight square at the same time. } 3. Rb8# *

Our goal is to force the king towards its own pawns where it will have limited movement.
Let's start with d5 to set up the checkmate (Qc5 would checkmate right away with the Swallow Tail mate). } 2. Qd5+ (2.
