52... Rf6 { Alekhine - Capablanca 1927
Let's start off by applying our rook endgame principles from previous courses.
In this situation, white has an outside passed pawn while each side still has three pawns and their kings on the kingside.
In order to make progress, white needs to maneuver their rook behind the passed pawn. This will limit the activity of the black rook and doom it to passivity.
Meanwhile, the white rook can keep an eye on both sides of the board.
We want to be behind our passed pawn, but it's best to do so from the fourth rank because we control a lot of space along that rank as well. } 53. Rd4 Ra6 54. Ra4 Kf6 { Now that our rook is behind the passed pawn, our goal is to activate the king.
Kings should be very active in end games so they can assist the rook by giving passed pawns the chance to turn into a queen. } 55. Kf3 Ke5 { We want to move towards the pawn. If we get the chance, we will move to b5 so we can push our pawn forward.
If black plays correctly to defend this, then we can create a counter threat on the kingside and attack the weak pawn on f7. } { [%cal Gf3d3,Gd3b5] } 56. Ke3 h5 { Both sets of pawns on each side have achieved what I will call the dream formation.
This includes the most backwards pawn being the f pawn.
The reason you want this pawn and not the h pawn is because the rook that is behind the passed pawn, or sometimes the king, can more easily protect the f pawn.
It creates more drawing chances for both sides, but more importantly, it's an easy formation to remember in case you're unsure how to position your pawns. } { [%csl Gf2,Gg3,Gh4] } 57. Kd3 Kd5 58. Kc3 Kc5 { In the game, Alekhine brought his rook to a2 to defend f2 and force the black king to make a decision which way it wants to go. } { [%cal Gc5b5,Gc3d4] } 59. Ra2 Kb5 { Now that the king is fully distracted by the passed pawn, we are free to navigate towards the weak f pawn.
Black can never capture the a pawn because his king will be too far out of position.
In the mean time, we can navigate along the dark squares towards the pawn on f7 and eventually win the game. } { [%cal Gc3e5,Ge5f4,Gf4h6,Gh6g7] } 60. Kd4 Rd6+ 61. Ke5 Re6+ 62. Kf4 Ka6 { [%cal Gf4h6,Gh6g7] } *

1... Rc4 { We touched briefly on the proper formation of your pawns, which I called the dream formation.
Another reason you'd want to have this formation is to protect against one side from gaining space and disconnecting your pawns from each other.
In this scenario, black's three pawns are already disconnected, but more importantly, the g and h pawns are not optimally positions to stop white from advancing the pawn. } 2. h5 g5 { White could have captured the h pawn, but this would create a more difficult scenario. I much prefer white's chances to win with the f and g pawns vs an h pawn.
In this case, black now has a backwards pawn that is difficult to defend and the g6 square is very weak. } 3. Rc6 (3. Kf3 e4+ 4. Ke3 Kf6 5. Rc6+ Ke5 6. Rxh6 Rxc5) 3... e4 { Take control of the g6 square, forcing the king to protect the h pawn and basically take their king out of the game, or abandon the h pawn, giving white two passed pawns. } 4. Rg6+ Kf7 { White has chosen to abandon the pawn.
We can create a passed h pawn, but why not keep both the c and h pawn on the board?
The great thing about the rook on g6 is that it can protect both pawns from the side. } 5. c6 *

1... Ra1 { Both sides have their pawns in a pretty ideal situation, however, we have white's rook in front of the pawn instead of behind it.
The winning method here for white is to move towards the passed a pawn, offering the f pawn for "free."
First, we can safely push the a pawn, forcing black to stay behind the pawn. } 2. a7 Ra2+ { Let's move towards the a pawn } 3. Kd3 Ra3+ { Let's move towards the a pawn } 4. Kc4 Ra4+ { Let's move towards the a pawn } 5. Kb5 Ra1 { Now our king can navigate away from checks by the rook and towards f7.
From this square, we'll be able to find safe haven on h6, move our rook and sacrifice the a pawn, in order to win the g and h pawns.
Often, the passed pawn is well defended, but by sacrificing it at the right time, we can win more material because it is such a burden for the defending side.
Let's move to c6 towards f7. } 6. Kc6 Ra2 { Let's move to d6 towards f7.
The reason we're choosing d6 and not d7 is because we have possibilities of setting up checkmate.
The black king's movement is very limited. } 7. Kd6 Ra3 { With black almost out of moves, we can force a win right here.
Black can never capture the pawn on f3 since white will move the rook, then advance the pawn, but the black king is out of moves.
We can threaten checkmate with the rook now, and also force the black rook to sacrifice itself to avoid mate. } 8. Rc8 Rxa7 { If Ra5, we would still play Rc5, forcing a trade of rooks and allowing the a pawn to queen.
It's a great idea to have a general plan in place. In this case, we want to work towards the h6 square with our king via f7, but there's no issue with shifting your plan if something better comes up along the way. } 9. Rc5# *

In these types of endings, it's important to look for scenarios where you can trade your rooks and the outside passed pawn, but transpose into a winning king and pawn endgame. } 2.

Due to white's active king, he can easily out maneuver his opponent. } 3. Re7+ Rxe7+ 4. Kxe7 Kg6 { Grab the opposition. } 5. Ke6 h5 { Black's pawns are now fixed and white can outflank his opponent since he has move space. } 6. Ke5 Kf7 7. Kxf5 *

1... Ra2 { This scenario shows what would happen if white did not choose the winning plan in the previous lesson.
It's important to always look for a superior position rather than winning material. We've seen this from Capablanca games in previous courses.
Let's assume that white wants to capture the f and g pawns instead, and give up the backwards f pawn. } 2. Kxf5 Rxf2+ { We can now capture the g pawn. } 3. Kxg4 Ra2 { You should notice an immediate advantage for black here, despite being down 2 pawns. The white king has no shelter and the rook has more activity than the white rook, despite being tied down to the a file.
By opening all lines an eliminating all possible pawn breaks, black is able to draw here.
Play Kf5 to try to make progress. } 4. Kf5 h5 { Immediately it's easy to see that any time white's king moves towards the h pawn, black's rook will check from the side and force it away.
If black ever needs to waste any moves, the black king can shift back and forth from g7 and h7, but never leaving these squares for fear of the classic skewer we've seen in previous courses.
Let's finish by moving towards the h pawn to see how easily black thwarts this attempt. } 5. Kg5 Ra5+ *

1... Ra3+ { This example shows how difficult it can be to win even with two extra pawns.
White is unable to activate their king without avoiding checks from the rook.
In this case, still try to create a passed f pawn, which we know wins against a king and rook vs our rook in front of the passed pawn.
We can attempt to create a passed f pawn to illustrate how it doesn't work in this scenario by moving the king towards h3. } 2. Kg2 Ra2+ { We want to go to h3 so we can push the g pawn.
We want to give up 2 pawns so we have a passed f pawn and the a pawn still. } 3. Kh3 Ra5 { Play g4 for a pawn sacrifice. } 4. g4 Ra3+ { If black captured the pawn, we'd be able to win thanks to sacrificing the h pawn and creating a passed f pawn. We'll see how in the next lesson.
For now, let's move back to g2. } 5. Kg2 hxg4 { We can now sacrifice the h pawn in our attempt to win with a passed f and a pawn. } 6. h5 gxh5 { Now our f pawn becomes active. The only reason we can't win is because the g and h pawns force white to give up the a pawn. } 7. f5 h4 8. f6+ Kf7 { This is the exception to the king on g7 and h7 rule. This only works for black because of the g and h pawns.
We can move to h7 and try to win with a skewer, but black doesn't have to capture the a pawn. } 9. Rh8 h3+ { Black's hidden check saves the game. Let's move to h2 to stay in front of the pawn. } 10. Kh2 Ra2+ { Move to g3. } 11. Kg3 Ra3+ { We're able to capture the g pawn, but it doesn't save the game. } 12. Kxg4 h2 { Black cleverly avoided the skewer we were hoping for the entire time thanks to their passed pawns. We're now forced to capture the pawns and enter a drawn rook and pawn vs rook endgame. } 13. Rxh2 Kxf6 { With our pawn close to queening on the a file, but white's king out of position, this is an easy draw for black.
He just moves towards the a pawn and eventually captures it with his rook. } *

1... Rb2 { Let's run through a scenario where black abandons the passed pawn and gets greedy.
We'll quickly see that black should never worry about material and should instead focus on keeping the passed pawn from queening.
Black has just attacked your f pawn, seemingly tying your king to its protection.
White could play f4, and create a weak pawn at g3, but white can use this time instead to move towards the passed pawn. } 2. Kd4 Rxf2 { Any time the rook stops threatening the passed pawn, and white's king is close enough to the pawn, white's rook can slide out from in front of the pawn.
Let's move to c7. } 3. Rc7 Rb2 { We can bring our king closer to the queening square now. } 4. Kc5 Rg2 { Oh no my pawn!
Black is playing with too much greed and it will not work out in his favor. } 5. b6 Rxg3 { Prevent the rook from coming back in front of the pawn.
Note that if the black rook slid back behind the pawn, we could still advance but have our rook defending from the side. This is helpful because the king can help advance the pawn, but it also stops black's f pawn from moving. } 6. Kc4 Rg1 { Similar to our Lucena practice, we want to build a bridge.
We have an opportunity to block any rook attempts to get behind the pawn with our own rook. } 7. Rc5 Rb1 8. Rb5 Rc1+ { Black cannot capture the rook of course. Move towards the queening square. } 9.

However, the pawn on the 6th allows white the chance to transfer the king to the aide of the passed pawn rather than stay stuck defending pawns on the kingside. } 2. Kf1 Rb2 { We can move towards the rook with ke1. } 3. Ke1 Kf6 { In order to move our king up the board, we want to create a weakness with f3. If black's rook moves to the third, we can move up to the second rank. } 4. f3 Rb3 { We don't have to worry about the f pawn. Our goal is to get to c2 to stop the rook from getting behind the pawn again.
We have a potential Rxf7+ sacrifice that could help us queen the pawn. } 5. Kd2 Rxf3 { We need to stop the rook from getting behind the passed pawn again. } 6. Kc2 Rxg3 { If black gets greedy and goes to more pawns, we can win by transferring our rook beside the pawn.
This helps keep pressure on the f7 pawn, but the white rook is also more active and can defend the pawn while still helping control the kingside.
The next lesson will look at what happens if we capture the f7 pawn. For now, we want to move to c7. } 7. Rc7 Rg2+ { Let's move towards our pawn to b3 } 8.

[SetUp "1"]

1... Ra3 { This scenario is very similar to the previous one. Our goal this time is to push f4 and create a passed e pawn.
Remember that the black rook is only an illusion. It can never help capture any pawns on the kingside without losing the game thanks to the Rh8+ tactic.
We first need to get our king to the first rank so our pawns are all free to move. Right now, they're all pinned by discovery. } 2. Kg2 Ra2+ 3. Kf1 Ra3 { The rook is not really threatening the f and g pawns since capturing them would lose the game. We can play f4 immediately. } 4. f4 exf4 5. gxf4 Ra4 { If the rook checked the king, it would need to move back to a4 and doesn't have time to capture the f4 pawn. } 6. e5 fxe5 { Once again, even with check, the rook cannot capture the f pawn. White would move to g2 and gain a passed e pawn anyway. } 7. fxe5 Ra5 8. e6 Re5 { If black's rook ever leaves the a file, we win with our standard rook sacrifice. } 9. Rh8+ Kxh8 10. a8=Q+ *
