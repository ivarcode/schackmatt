1... d2 { Rook endgames are the most likely endgame scenarios. One outcome of rook endgames is each side with a rook and a pawn. One side may eventually need to sacrifice their rook for the queening pawn.
What remains is a race to see whether or not the rook can capture the remaining pawn and win the game, or whether it must sacrifice itself for the pawn and the game is drawn.
This lesson will look at most scenarios where you can win the pawn when it starts on the 7th, 6th, 5th, or 4th ranks.
The key here for the d pawn is if your rook is behind the pawn, you need to be in the highlighted zone (a4-f4, f3, g2, or h1) in order to win the pawn when it is on the 7th.
You don't need to memorize this zone like other endgames, but it's helpful to understand why.
The king needs to be able to help attack the pawn before it queens. } { [%csl Ga4,Gb4,Gc4,Gd4,Ge4,Gf4,Gf3,Gg2,Gh1] } 2. Kb3 Ke2 { The black king needs to support the pawn forward so it must help aid the pawn to the queening square. This will help give white time to put a second attacker on the pawn. } 3.

1... c2 { Let's take a moment to see how important the space of a central pawn is. Shifting over just one file turns this scenario into a draw with white to move.
The rook doesn't have much space and we can't let the king into d2 or the game is drawn (and possible to lose if you're not careful).
Keep in mind that Queen vs Rook is a tricky endgame that doesn't always have a concrete path forward for either side and you can consider it a draw unless you have specific circumstances you find yourself in. } 2. Ra1 Kc3 { We need our rook in front of the pawn when the king moves to c3.
Now we have to bring our rook back in front of the pawn. } 3. Rc1 Kd3 { If the king went to b2, then we would win because we can move into d2. Since no progress can be made, this game will end in a draw. } 4. Ra1 *

1... b4 { Let's take a moment to reflect on the key idea in one of our rook principles - cutting the king off.
Right now, the king cannot move any closer to the pawn since it is cut off. We can now bring our king closer. } 2. Kg7 b3 { The pawn is unable to queen on its own and must have the help of the king.
With the king cut off, we don't need to move our king closer anymore. We can just use our rook to finish the game. } 3. Rh3 b2 4. Rb3 *

1... Kb2 { The pawn on the 7th was simpler. Let's see what happens with the pawn on the 6th rank to start.
Begin by taking the opposition. } 2. Kb4 a2 { Now we can check the king because we have mating threats on our side. } 3. Rh2+ Kb1 4. Kb3 { Black is forced to underpromote the pawn into a knight. If he promotes into a queen, he is mated. } 4... a1=N+ 5. Kc3 { Black is out of moves and must give up the knight or else be checkmated.
There are many instances where the rook vs knight can be drawn as long as the knight stays close to the king. In this case, the knight must start in the corner and he is lost. } *

1... Rd6+ { A tricky situation to keep in mind that may occur is known as the Saavedra position.
White has pushed their pawn to the 7th and it seems like the rook cannot capture the pawn. There is a trick to win this as white.
The king cannot move to the c file or black will draw by playing Rc1 and skewering the king to the pawn.
The king also cannot move to b7 or the the rook will pin the pawn to the king and draw the game.
Instead, white must stay on the b file } 2. Kb5 Rd5+ { White must stay on the b file } 3. Kb4 Rd4+ { White must stay on the b file } 4. Kb3 Rd3+ { Only now can we move to c2. } 5. Kc2 Rd4 { A clever trick. If white promotes to a queen it's a stalemate since the black king is out of moves.
We instead need to underpromote. } 6. c8=R Ra4 { Black now has to block against mate on a8. This allows us to create a double threat against the rook and the king at the same time. } 7. Kb3 Kb1 { Black had to prevent mate so we win the rook. } 8. Kxa4 *
