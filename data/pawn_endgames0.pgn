1... Kf8 { Before we talk about anything advanced, it’s important to touch base on the rule of the square. The square tells you at a glance whether or not the pawn will queen, or if the king can catch the pawn in time on its own.
Count the number of squares your pawn is away from the queening square (in this case 4 squares). Then count 4 squares to the right from the queening square, then down 4 squares, then 4 squares back to the pawn itself. You will always be able to make a square with all four sides being the number of squares from the queening square.
If the black king can step into the square before the pawn moves, then the king is in time to stop the pawn from queening.
If the king steps outside of the square in our more advanced pawn studies, we will be able to determine that the attacking side (with the pawn) will win. } 2. a5 Ke8 3. a6 Kd7 4. a7 Kc8 5. a8=Q+ Kc7 *

1... Kf3 { The previous game showed black to move, but what if white is to move. Black occupies the corresponding square of f3 to d2. White needs to be able to get to either d4, where he can move to capture the b pawn and win, or get to e2 or e3 as we saw in the previous game. This makes d4, e2, and e3 key squares that white wants to get to.
Therefore, to start looking for corresponding squares, we want to first think of what the key squares are that would win for white.
So identifying d2's corresponding squares as f3 can be done because it's the only square black can stop e2 and e3 at the same time. White can't move to e1 since black will take the opposition, so white begins moving towards d4, the other key square. At the same time, we want keep an eye on the way back to possibly get into e2 and e3 at the same time.

Because we know c3 and e3 are corresponding squares, then we want to think about the squares that can reach c3 for white. They are b2, b3, and c2.
Thinking about the goal of white to go to c3 or d2 from c2, the corresponding square for black is f4 because black is able to stop both plans of white from this square.
Therefore our goal is to triangulate and transfer the move to black so that he occupies a corresponding square while it is his own move. This forces a Zugzwang as black must vacate the right square.

1... Kg6 { Bahr's rule occurs when counting whether or not the king is able to capture an outside passed pawn, and make it back in time to draw against a rook pawn.
There are a few things to keep in mind
1. The attacking rook pawn must not have crossed the middle of the board (5th rank of higher)
2. The attacking King must be standing directly beside the passed pawn
3. The defending King must be standing directly in front of either the passed pawn or the attacking King.
To make it easier to evaluate whether or not the king can make it back in time, you can think of an imaginery line that stems from the enemy pawn. This line is known as the "Border Line."
The border line is traced from the defending pawn to the second rank, and then back towards the opposing second rank.
If the passed pawn is within the line from the diagram, then it is a win. If the passed pawn outside the line, the position is drawn.
Once the enemy king captures the pawn, it must be determined if the king can either make it to the f8 square from this position, or whether the king can block the attacking king from escaping from the edge of the board in front of the pawn.
Let's force the king up the board with h5. } { [%cal Ga5c7,Gc7h2] } 2. h5+ Kh7 { Move to g5. } 3. Kg5 Kg7 { Force the king up again with h6. } 4. h6+ Kh8 { Since we clearly cannot win with a rook pawn and the opponent's king in front of the pawn, we need to go after the a pawn and jettison the h pawn.
The question is whether or not the king can make it to the key square of c8 to prevent us from promoting our a pawn.
According to our rule, the pawn is outside of the border line and the game is drawn. Let's move our king in a straight line to the a pawn to see if the black king is in time. } 5.

e4 is mined because if white steps into e4, black draws with the immediate d5. If white takes the pawn, his pawn on d4 is ahead of the king and white can never win.
